## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/JaniSaelin/janisaelin.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### So let's try this out...
How to make a bulleted list:
- Start with a dash/minus sign
- Add a space after the dash
- Type whatever you want!

How to make a numbered list:
1. Start with the number
2. Then the period
3. Then the space
4. Type whatever you want!

So let's play around with manipulating other parts of the text. If you want to **bolden your text** you can simply encompass the desired text with two asterisks on both ends.

For _italicized text_ you can encompass your desired text with single underscores on both ends. 

And then, there's `code text` which you encompass with that apostrophe-looking symbol thing under the tilda (~) button next to your "1" key. (EDIT: I found out that they're called "back-ticks"). These back-ticks can also perform syntax highlighting. For example, if you're writing Python code:

```python
a = 45
b = 29
c = a + b
print(c)

for i in range (c):
  if (i % 2 == 0):
    print(i)
  elif(i % 5 == 0):
    print(i * 5)
    
```

You can [embed a text with links](https://github.com/) by wrapping brackets around the text and providing hte URL in parentheses immediately after the closed text. 

Finally, you can include images in your website.

To do this, type ```![text](url)```.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/JaniSaelin/janisaelin.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
